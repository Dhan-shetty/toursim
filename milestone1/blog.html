    <h2><strong> Coastal Karnataka Diary - Sojourn of Mangalore and around
    </strong> </h2>
<br>
<date>November 20, 2019</date>
<p>
    What is the first thought that comes to mind when we talk about the coastal town of Mangalore - For me since my first visit to Udupi, I was in love with the beaches and veg south Indian food so for me these were the two things topmost in my mind when I set out for my 2nd city sojourn in coastal Karnataka - Mangalore. Though being much larger in size as compared to Udupi it wasn't easy to travel length and breath of the city in a way I love to travel - in public transport and still be able to tick all attractions of the town from the bucket list. With limited holidays in hand I set out on my solo trip to Mangalore and nearby holy city of Dhamasthala.
